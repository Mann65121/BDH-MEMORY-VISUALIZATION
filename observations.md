During early learning stages, sparse memory graphs often appear nearly empty.
This is not a bug but a property of sparse systems, where strong structure only
emerges after repeated co-activation.

This behavior supports the claim that sparse memory reduces interference
but requires sufficient exposure to form stable representations.
